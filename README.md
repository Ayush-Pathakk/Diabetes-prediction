#  Diabetes Prediction ðŸ©º
Overview

Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide. Early detection helps in better treatment and lifestyle management.
This project uses Machine Learning (Support Vector Machine) to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes based on diagnostic health data.

Dataset

Source: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset â€“ Kaggle/UCI Repository]

Target Variable: 0 â†’ Non-Diabetic, 1 â†’ Diabetic

Workflow

Import libraries & load dataset

Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling features)

Train-test split

Train model using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluate model performance (accuracy score)

Tech Stack
